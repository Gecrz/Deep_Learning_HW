In this homework, the goal was tp create to LSTM RNN architecture and apply the same model elements to two notebooks, one fitting FNG values and the other only closing prices.

After fitting and training the models I reached the following conclusions: 

Which model has a lower loss?

> The model for closing prices appear to have the lower loss. 

Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

> The model for closing prices also seems to track values better over time. 

Which window size works best for the model?

> Window size 9 apperar to fit better for the model in terms of accuracy and lower loss.
